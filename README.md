# East African Oil Price Analysis
## Final Capstone for the 30-Day Challenge by [Zindua School](https://zinduaschool.com)
This project involves: database design, data consolidation into an relational databse, as well as data analysis and visualisation of oil prices across major economies in the East African Community: Kenya and Tanzania alongside the global price benchmark.

### Data Sourced from Official Oil Regulators
#### About Dataset
Data from every country had to be sourced from its official Oil Regulator i.e EPRA in Kenya, EWURA in Tanzania, and global data has been sourced from the World Bank.

#### Content
The data contains information on oil price caps across different regions in Kenya and Tanzania i.e. Petrol, Diesel, and Kerosene. Global data simply gives the monthly average global prices for the same three commodities.
